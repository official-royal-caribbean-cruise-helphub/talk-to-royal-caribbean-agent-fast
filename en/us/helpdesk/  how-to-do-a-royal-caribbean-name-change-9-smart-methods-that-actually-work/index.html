  <div class="container">
    <p>If your cruise +1-855-690-1232 ticket has the wrong name, don’t panic! Here's a step-by-step breakdown of 10 ways to get it corrected before your Royal Caribbean voyage.</p>

    <h2>1. Contact Customer Service Immediately</h2>
    <p>Call Royal Caribbean support or use live chat to report name discrepancies early. This improves your chances of a smooth correction.</p>

    <h2>2. Use The Online Cruise Planner</h2>
    <p>In some cases, minor updates can be done online through the Cruise Planner under your reservation settings.</p>

    <h2>3. Correct Spelling Errors Quickly</h2>
    <p>Misspellings or typos can often be fixed free of charge if corrected early — ideally more than 75 days before departure.</p>

    <h2>4. Request a Name Change Form</h2>
    <p>For major changes or transfers, you may need to fill out a formal request or form provided by Royal Caribbean's support.</p>

    <h2>5. Review Fare Terms</h2>
    <p>Different fare types have different change policies — non-refundable fares may have stricter limits or fees.</p>

    <h2>6. Provide Legal Documentation</h2>
    <p>For name changes due to marriage, divorce, or legal reasons, submit ID copies or legal documents as proof.</p>

    <h2>7. Involve Your Travel Agent</h2>
    <p>If you booked through an agent, they can assist directly with Royal Caribbean’s systems for a faster resolution.</p>

    <h2>8. Track the Change Confirmation</h2>
    <p>Always ask for written/email confirmation of the change for check-in and boarding safety.</p>

    <h2>9. Avoid Last-Minute Changes</h2>
    <p>Trying to correct a name within 48 hours of sailing can result in denial to board. Start early!</p>

    <h2>10. Check Airline Tickets</h2>
    <p>If your cruise package includes flights, coordinate name changes with both cruise and airline partners to avoid mismatch.</p>
